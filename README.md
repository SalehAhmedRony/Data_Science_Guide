## Introduction
So you've decided to figure out what AI, machine learning, and data science is all about. Congratulations! This is going to be a long journey, but, as [Hari Seldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon) said, "[is] there anything more exciting in life than seeking answers?". Whether you're actually looking for a career change, or just want to learn something new, I think you'll find that the more data science & ML you learn, the more applications you'll find to apply it in your personal and/or work related projects. So, best of luck & happy learning!

Note: This doc/guide is a work-in-progress. Feel free to contact me with any suggestions/comments/requests. My hope is that some day it will be sufficiently developed to the point where I will publish it on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com)

## Approach
To really dive-deep in ML, you need to immerse yourself in it. There are 4 key steps you should take towards this end: 

1. Start following [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com)
2. Take massive online open courses (MOOCs) while simultaneously working on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) projects.
3. Build your own API/package & use it in your projects and/or at work.
4. Always look for ways to apply your new ML/data science techniques to your day time job

## Why should you follow Towards Data Science? 
There are many data science & machine learning blogs out there, and many of them are outstanding. In particular, I have found Jason Brownlee's [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com) blog to be a great resource for many things. However, what's so great about Towards Data Science is that there are countless authors publish articles that cover all of data science & ML, while simultaneously offering different perspectives on the same subject. Furthermore, Toward's Data Science is a great filter for academic literature, meaning that the high-level articles published there often reference various papers which could be read if you wish to dive deeper in one area or another.

Below are some good articles to get you started:

## Why Build Your Own API/Package
One of the key [principles of programming](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/basic-programming-principles/) is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This is probably actually a good principle to live by in general, since repeating yourself is a waste of time. In data science & ML, particularly in more basic problems, the steps you take to do some explorarory data analysis (EDA) and build and test a model are often quite similar. Thus, I recommend you start building your own API/Package to try to automate these steps for your own work-flows. Aside minimizing the number of times you repeat yourself, this will also start to get you familiar with more Dev-Ops side of things, such as building a package, running unit tests, code coverage, and much more. Furthermore, your API will be a good reference point where you can point people to see some code you've independantly built, and perhaps one day you'll even be able to use it in practice problems you may be given for job interviews. The API I built, and continue to build on occasion is [pyDSlib](https://github.com/jlnerd/pyDSlib). Feel free to go check it out if you're curious.

## Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) Overview
MOOCs are the best place to start if you're trying to get into data science/ML. The data science/ML community in particular seems to have really outstanding MOOCs which give you the basic knowledge you need to go off and start working on projects independantly. There are basically 5 big MOOC companies heavily competing:

1. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)
2. [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com)
3. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com)
4. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

In my opinion, Coursera & Data Camp are the best. The courses are the most well structured with high quality instructional videos, examples, and practice problems. Of course, things do very somewhat from course to course within each of the MOOC companies, so if you see something interesting offered by any of these, you should definateley go check it out.

Another commonly asked question related to MOOCs is whether or not the certificates they offer mater. Most people say no, and I agree that having 1 or 2 certificates from MOOCs doesn't really matter. However, if you have 20, 30, 40 certificates, I think this starts to have an impact. This shows you've invested a really significant amount of time to independantly learn this subject, and if you've taken that many courses and have projects as well, you'll probably be able to get pretty technical on a lot of data science/ML topics.

Aside from MOOCs, many Universities offer more thorough certicate programs, at a cost. I've taken such a program, and I was rather disapointed. One of the problems with my particular course was that it focused on using R. Just don't use R. It's on it's way out and honestly it's a waste of your time to learn it. The other problem, and arguably the more important problem with these kinds of programs from acredited universities, is that they prevent you from focusing your learning on areas you are most uncertain about or most interested in. In my experience, you can more quickly get up to speed if you have the flexibility to decide yourself what area you need to dive deeper on.

One question I found myself asking when I first started getting into ML was "which types of models should I really focus on". There are so many models out there and it can be a bit overwhelming at first if you think you need to be a master of all of them and understand each and every hyperparameter/architecture within each model. Fortunately, there a really just 2 types of general model styles/classes people are heavily using today:

1. Neural Networks (via [Tensorflow w/ Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)) 
2. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (via [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html))

It's super important to learn about SVMs, KNNs, and all the other models out there, but you should really focus on becoming an expert in using Tensorflow & xgboost, as these two APIs have the widest use in industry. Also, it is of note that you rarely hear of decisions trees in the press, however xgboost is an extremely powerful model which can often perform better than neural networks (simpler model, less prone to overfitting, faster prediction, etc.) on many tasks, so don't buy into all the hype completely.

## Guide to MOOCs
Below are the MOOCs I recommend taking. They are roughly ordered, but you should feel free to jump around a bit if you'd like. Also, while you're working on MOOCs, try to work on a Kaggle competition/project as well. The Kaggle competitions I recommend are listed in the next section

3. [Coursera: Specialization: Deep Learning, deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)</br>
*This series of courses will get you ready to use Tensorflow. In my opinion, Tensorflow 1.x was a pretty confusing API. There so many ways to do the same thing and just getting a model setup was a bit tedious. Tensorflow 2.x integrated another super popular neural network API, Keras, into its main code, and focused on using the much more elegant higher-level architecture building style that keras provides. Many of the early courses focused on neural networks will leverage Tensorflow 1.x and may show you some non-ideal styles of building models, however as you progress you'll start to leverage the keras-style of model definition, which will greatly simplify things.*

*So, you've done it! You can fetch data, clean it, run some feature engineering and model selection and save your best model. What's the next step? Deploying the model! There are many ways to deploy a model, however one of the most interesting/exciting ways to deploy the model would be to deploy it to an app. For this reason, we'll start by learning how to build general iOS Apps in Swift (this will also get you exposure to a new programming language), Then, in the next specialization, we'll learn how to use TensorFlow Lite to deploy pre-trained models to Java & Swift.*

## Guide to Kaggle
Below are the Kaggle projects/competitions I recommend taking. As with the MOOCs, they are roughly sorted in the order they should be completed. When working on Kaggle competitions, you should push your results to your public github. This will beef-up your github account while giving you practice of working with git and managing projects with models that may require large datasets and/or outputs large files that cannot be saved in git. Also, be sure to checkout the Notebooks published on each project page. Seeing how other data scientists/ML experts do exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and more, is one of the key reasons why doing projects via Kaggle can be so effective as a learning technique.
